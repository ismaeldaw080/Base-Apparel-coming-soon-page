## My process

1ยบ I designed the HTML structure to be more semantic posible.
    All the entire content is inside on one container in this case a main markup because its the "body" of this website.
    Then i created two sections to divide the container in two columns, the left column have the titles, paragraphs and form, the right column have the background image.

2ยบ When the HTML estructure was completly created i started creating the css.
  First i import all styles from style-guide.md, then created a root element to put the colors, fonts, weights that i need to use later with var().
  I used the flex property to set the 2 columns with centered elements and displays in column
  Left column have 60% of width and the right column have 40% width.

  The most noteworthy in this CSS stylesheet is the (Error Button) and (Send Form Arrow), the entire form is position relative and the error button and send form arrow are position relative.



### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript ECMA6

### What I learned

In this project i learned the semantic HTML5 markup (picture,small), with CSS in learned to better understand positions relatives and absolutes, however i learned to do a good style form with customs icons and custom errors posts.

With JS i learned how to manage custom validity form, how to create regular expresions to check if the value of input is valid value.

However i discover but not used the CSS selectors :valid , :invalid and in JS the validityState.badInput.

```html
<picture>
  <img id="logo" src="./images/logo.svg" alt="logotipo" />
</picture>
```

```js
let formatoEmail = /^\w+([\.-]?\w+)*@\w+([\.-]?\w+)*(\.\w{2,3})+$/;
```


### Continued development

I want to refine and perfect the positions relatives and absolutes, the JS code to refactorize it and want to learn how use te CSS selectors :valid , :invalid and in JS the validityState.badInput just in case in future i need it.
